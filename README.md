# Drop_Modelling_and_Fitting

 Scripts to plot data from triboelectric charge experiments and estimate the extent of experimental particle precharging and selfcharging. The data used for these plots is avalible at https://www.doi.org/10.18126/n3dx-dh16.

 A summary of the codes' functionalities are as follows:
Drop_Plotter.py - Plots the Fararday cup triboelectricity measurements.
Drop_Trace_Model.py - Calculates the time taken for paticles to fall to the Faraday cup.
Continuous_Trace_Model.py - Calculates the expected Fararday cup trace and components given size and charge distributions.
Continuous_Fitter.py - Lets the expected Fararday cup trace be fit manually to the measured trace.
Automated_Fitter.py - Automatically fits the expected Fararday cup trace to that measured experimentally given an initial guess.
Camsizer_Plotter.py - Plots and fits the size distributions for data from the CAMSIZER X2.
Mastersizer_Plotter.py - Plots and fits the size distributions for data from the Mastersizer 3000.
Ring_Fitter.py - Fits traces for ring charge sensors rather than Farday cups
