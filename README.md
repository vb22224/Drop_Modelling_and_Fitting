# Drop_Modelling_and_Fitting

 Scripts to both plot data from triboelectric charge experiments (Drop_Plotter.py) and model the dicretised trace expected (Drop_Trace_Model.py) to be seen by a Faraday cup to estimate the extent of experimental particle precharging and selfcharging.

These are then adapted to form a continous trace in the Continous_Trace_Model.py, which can be fit by hand in the Continuos_Fitter.py and automatically with the Automated_Fitter.py.
